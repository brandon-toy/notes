## Quick quotes and reflections

> "The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory"

Context surrounding this is how important love is as a goal for humanity. How the author understtood at a moment of cruelty that love "is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire."

Still don't know how and what this quote means. But a similar experience reminded me of this quote!

When I was hiking in Taiwan, there was a point called elephant mountain. I heard that it was hella busy so I decided just search in google maps and enter from a random area. I was completely alone and the hike was actually very well lit up. I was following a group of high school kids that were going to catch the taipei 101 as well until they took a break and I continued on. The path got darker and darker and there were many separating paths. Eventually there was a big red sign in chinese that I did not understand a word. I translated it and it basically told me to f off and the part here gets very steep.

I decided to keep going, my idiotic brain was kind of excited for the challenge. IDK what I was thinking, next thing I know I was basically rock climbing alone, it the dark while holding my phone. I was terrified but the one thing that kept me going was bean. I thought of here, in her homeland and her spirit was with me. It basically felt like she was there. This entire time with my whole being. It was an experience that was surreal. I remember it so vividly...

The author shares a similar experience when looking at the sun on a super harsh day and in that moment, all the pain and all the suffering around him. Basically being in hell. It didn't matter, this love and memory transcended all of those. I can say that I can relate and that is super cool, but I still can't understand this quote.

> "No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar siutation he might not have done the same."

Context:

In the camps the prisoners clearly held favourites and poured soup for each other. The soup was not very nutrituous and all the peas were in the bottom of the soup bowl. Volunteers when pouring soup would give the peas to the people they knew. People started to get reputations of people who favoured certain people.

Reflection:
Judgement is such an interesting topic. It feels like pressure almost, judgement. It feels easy, to judge to walk by and live life like that. But the author kind of just like blew me away when I first read this. The first gut reaction was like thats not ok. But really thinking about it, I would totally do the same. Is it fair for me to pass on things like that to other people, when in the same position I would def do the same - favour my friends and close ones. This quote is a good reminder to me to always not do the right thing, but to find the intention of my judgement and to be more empathic to other people.

I can't say I ever pass judgement on to people and idk. The most recent one on the mind is how dirty my working space is. Well not dirty but, mess here and there and how I am not being a good bf. Like basically all things, never "good" and "bad", but these judgements are my intention to have a clean and healthy space for me to live in and I am glad I have this mechanism to do this! Just feels that this emotion/way of living is something that can quickly go overboard.
