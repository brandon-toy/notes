# Man's Search for Meaning

_By Viktor Frankl_

## Overview

Viktor Frankl's profound exploration of finding meaning in the most difficult circumstances, based on his experiences as a Holocaust survivor and his development of logotherapy.

## Key Concepts

### The Will to Meaning

Frankl argues that the primary human drive is not pleasure (Freud) or power (Adler), but the search for meaning.

### Three Sources of Meaning

1. **Creative values** - What we give to the world through our work and deeds
2. **Experiential values** - What we take from the world through encounters and experiences
3. **Attitudinal values** - The stance we take toward unavoidable suffering

## Notable Quotes

> "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedomsâ€”to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."

> "Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'."
