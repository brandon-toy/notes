## Quick quotes and reflections

> "The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory"

Context surrounding this is how important love is as a goal for humanity. How the author understtood at a moment of cruelty that love "is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire."

Still don't know how and what this quote means. But a similar experience reminded me of this quote!

When I was hiking in Taiwan, there was a point called elephant mountain. I heard that it was hella busy so I decided just search in google maps and enter from a random area. I was completely alone and the hike was actually very well lit up. I was following a group of high school kids that were going to catch the taipei 101 as well until they took a break and I continued on. The path got darker and darker and there were many separating paths. Eventually there was a big red sign in chinese that I did not understand a word. I translated it and it basically told me to f off and the part here gets very steep.

I decided to keep going, my idiotic brain was kind of excited for the challenge. IDK what I was thinking, next thing I know I was basically rock climbing alone, it the dark while holding my phone. I was terrified but the one thing that kept me going was bean. I thought of here, in her homeland and her spirit was with me. It basically felt like she was there. This entire time with my whole being. It was an experience that was surreal. I remember it so vividly...

The author shares a similar experience when looking at the sun on a super harsh day and in that moment, all the pain and all the suffering around him. Basically being in hell. It didn't matter, this love and memory transcended all of those. I can say that I can relate and that is super cool, but I still can't understand this quote.
