## Quotes and Reflections

> ### "The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory"

**Context:** surrounding this is how important love is as a goal for humanity. How the author understood at a moment of cruelty that love "is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire."

Still don't know how and what this quote means. But a similar experience reminded me of this quote!

When I was hiking in Taiwan, there was a point called elephant mountain. I heard that it was hella busy so I decided just search in google maps and enter from a random area. I was completely alone and the hike was actually very well lit up. I was following a group of high school kids that were going to catch the taipei 101 as well until they took a break and I continued on. The path got darker and darker and there were many separating paths. Eventually there was a big red sign in chinese that I did not understand a word. I translated it and it basically told me to f off and the part here gets very steep.

I decided to keep going, my idiotic brain was kind of excited for the challenge. IDK what I was thinking, next thing I know I was basically rock climbing alone, it the dark while holding my phone. I was terrified but the one thing that kept me going was bean. I thought of here, in her homeland and her spirit was with me. It basically felt like she was there. This entire time with my whole being. It was an experience that was surreal. I remember it so vividly...

The author shares a similar experience when looking at the sun on a super harsh day and in that moment, all the pain and all the suffering around him. Basically being in hell. It didn't matter, this love and memory transcended all of those. I can say that I can relate and that is super cool, but I still can't understand this quote.

> ### "No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same."

**Context:**

In the camps the prisoners clearly held favourites and poured soup for each other. The soup was not very nutritious and all the peas were in the bottom of the soup bowl. Volunteers when pouring soup would give the peas to the people they knew. People started to get reputations of people who favoured certain people.

**Reflection:**

Judgement is such an interesting topic. It feels like pressure almost, judgement. It feels easy, to judge to walk by and live life like that. But the author kind of just like blew me away when I first read this. The first gut reaction was like thats not ok. But really thinking about it, I would totally do the same. Is it fair for me to pass on things like that to other people, when in the same position I would def do the same - favour my friends and close ones. This quote is a good reminder to me to always not do the right thing, but to find the intention of my judgement and to be more empathic to other people.

I can't say I ever pass judgement on to people and idk. The most recent one on the mind is how dirty my working space is. Well not dirty but, mess here and there and how I am not being a good bf. Like basically all things, never "good" and "bad", but these judgements are my intention to have a clean and healthy space for me to live in and I am glad I have this mechanism to do this! Just feels that this emotion/way of living is something that can quickly go overboard.

> ### "[T]he last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."

**Context:**

People who live in the camps remember the kind acts of other men. Men who would give their last piece of bread (I think they only had like a couple pieces a day).

**Reflection:**

Really spoke to me because I feel like I have heard so many people say that they are trapped. I remember hearing about Google engineers and how some of them feel like they are just trapped. In the grand scheme of things, objectively, they are probably the most free people to ever exist. Millionares, but they feel trapped. I thought it was super interesting that in the face of a country doing everything possible to make humans feel like they have no choice but to work, people and humanity still finds ways to give and choices to make.

This mindset of being trapped is something I also feel like at Amazon. Feeling like I am trapped to by some dollar amount to reach some goal. It does feel like there is no alternative but I do know the state of privelage I am in. My goal of retiring early feels in reach but also out of. Like so many things need to go right for it to happen. Like trapped by society and every problem and every mistake I make in work is kind of amplified. Not currently sure what to do, but I would like my brain to take everything as a learning experience and one thing that really helped me was watching Dr. K and him being like, everything that happens in our life is something to help us get somewhere. A loss of my job is a pathway to the next experience, maybe it won't even be in tech! Its scary to think about but also, that is also a good thing then!

> ### "Here lies the change for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not."

**Context:**

The author is talking about meaning in suffering. Trying to find some meaning in the suffering of him and his peers are going around the camp. The author talks about having an active life and a passive life of enjoyment.

> Active life
Serves the purpose of giving man opportunity to realize values in creative work

> Passive life
Affords opportunity to find fulfillment in beauty, art or nature

If there is meaning in life at all, then there must be meaning in Suffering

Suffering is a natural part of death, without it and death, human life is not complete

> "The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity-even under the most difficult circumstances-to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal."

**Reflection:**

My first thought when reading this was like I don't understand what the author is talking about. As I read it twice, thrice and even 4 times. I think I percieve it as the author saying that there is a certain beauty in suffering and learning to accept that in life we will suffer. 

This line:

> "the way in which he takes up his cross"

I don't quite understand the intent, but to my knowledge it is saying the way we own up and look within our suffering. Our actions. By doing this, by looking at the suffering and taking ownership and acceptance. We can add a depper meaning in to life itself. 

All this talk of suffering really reminded me of Buddhist texts about life in itself is suffering and perceiving that as a negative thing. What if the point wasn't that it was not a negative thing, the story of the man running from a lion or tiger to only jump off a cliff to his pending doom into a pit of hydras is a story that really resonates with me. The lion/tiger symbolizing death itself. 

As I bring this suffering to my awareness and acceptance of it I had a thought about how I should approach this. Maybe I should believe that sometimes I won't understand the meaning of this suffering. i.e. why is this happening to ME. But maybe I will look back and be like huh, I learned so much from that day/experience! So much that I can be grateful for. 

I do believe that is kind of the meaning of this excerpt of the book so far that the book is trying to communicate!

> ### "They preferred to close their eyes and to live in the past. Life for such people became meaningless."

**Context:**

This was talking about how important looking into the future was. If someone was not future looking they will be filled with retrospective thoughts.

Tendency was to look into the past to help make the present and its reality less real. However it seems like there is this robbing of the present and its reality lay another danger. 

Even in the most dire situations, humanity finds ways to find the positives in something. As such despite all odds, there was still positive of camp life. 
Prisoners seem to lose hold on their life, everything just started to become pointless. 

The author then says to view camp as a test of their inner strength and a chance to grow spiritually. By living in the past and ignoring the futures, it seemed to bring people closer to death.

**Reflection:**

This passage really spoke to me. I do find myself having an inner monologue of like other people that seem to be talking to me and I can think of many people of the top of my head that kind of ignore the present and live in the past. They paint this rosy picture of the past and robbing themselves of the present. Root cause? Idk can only speculate, but I find that thinking about the past to be painful at times, but also rewarding. It is kind of why I started this website. To jot down some notes such that I have a place to confer and smile. 

I can think of so many times to grow spirituality, however I feel like humanity has moved on from this spiritual connection. I would love to explore this further! Spiritual connection has been replaced with science, even though it seems like all the psychology seems to point to having a strong inner sense of self which is basically just a having a strong spirit. 

Back to the topic, I feel myself instead of sitting with boredom, instead of moving along with routines of sleeping at a certain time, i move quickly between tasks. Kind of struggling to commit, but also taking lazy ways, getting spurts of energy to work on certain things. Being consistent is such an impossible challenge it feels like... Something I really admire about bean ❤️

> ### "It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future -- sub specie aeternitatis"


**Context:**
The doctor is going through some gruelling suffering, limping several kilometres from camp to work site in the bitter cold and kept thinking about food.

One technique that the doctor seemed to use was visualizing himself standing on the platform of a well-lit, warm and pleasant lecture room, giving a lecture on psychology of the concentration camp. 

It was so powerful that it seemed that his current suffering was a thing in the past. 

> "Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it"

**Reflection:**

Wanted to share this with bean, and my mind went to all the visions of the future I have. Maybe it makes the present a little more comfortable. I don't seem to ask myself. Am I happy?

I think some of my goals I pride myself on, are so big and the way to achieve those things is just to be boring that I struggle with that. My brain craves for those dopamine hits and I am still trying to learn how to enjoy the ride.

Some visions I see currently:
- Me teaching someone in something
- Creating a video games
- Retiring early
- Taking the kids to school
- People around me passing away, and attending their funeral
- Wedding 

These are such big events and big parts of me that I find myself day dreaming. I find myself scrolling on my phone and checking my net worth so much, TOO Much. I do mental calculations in my head as I am obsessed with finances and retiring early.  

Puer aeternus has been in my mind recently and yea, the hard work of this goal is to just be boring and to enjoy the ride and to enjoy my working years. I find myself currently struggling with that.

> ### "When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single unique task"

**Context**

The author just finished giving an inspirational speech about suffering and the meanings from life and the attitude one should approach life with.

Another quote that is interesting:

> it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. 

Think about life as being questioned about on the daily, hourly, etc.  Life is about the right action in the right conduct. Taking responsibility to answer problems and fulfill tasks set by which life is set by the individual.

The author rights about the meaning of life in these tasks and how it is different from man to man, moment to moment.

Because of the nature of these tasks, the question has seemed to stump people who try to answer it in sweeping statements. These tasks will form man's destiny and it is unique and different for each individual.

Bringing back the original quote about destiny to suffer, acknowledge the fact that this suffering is done through alone and unique. No one can relieve him of his suffering/suffer in his place.

**Reflection**

This is a pretty timely way to reflect about this quote as I just had a discussion with my mom and currently thinking about how much emotional load that I feel that I should be handling. Because of the quote it feels easy for me to be like LOOK at this, this is a form of suffering and you must go through it alone. I do know that is true, only we can heal our own suffering but I do know the power of feeling like you are supported. The truth is that I find it difficult to just "keep" up in life and find myself stretching myself too thin at times. I want to grow and maintain all my connections and I do feel like it is hard to quantify how much "support" I should be giving a single person. 

Part of my identity is bean now and it is important I emotionally separate myself with my mother. I remember she told me that it feels that I am making other people a priority vs her and all this feels super "selfish?" It still doesn't sit right, like this constant comparison of other people in my life and compare it to her. 

Going forward this quote really helps me reaffirm that we are the ones in the driver seat to our own suffering. Man's choice to perceive this suffering and turn it into something great is up to them. No-one else can do it for them, and I do wonder about the role of "support" and how that can help in this, if even at all?
