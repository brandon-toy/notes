day 2:

- woke up, bean smile in the darkness
- was smiling, enjoying! and then fire alarm blurted us out
- quickly job away, bean helped a person carry a cat carridge!
- she also donated to this homeless guy
- QVM, insanely big, lady complain to Louisa about how China is so much better
- sit there, blank face, told bean that she should pursue her dreams and meaning. even if I am there, want that for her!
- had amazing bratwurst, highlihgt for me was the spice mix and all the architecture
- everywhere around downtown melbourne is so nice, so artsy and beautiful..
- amazing protest of israel vs palestine
- walk over to NGV, take photos, watch sunset talk about comparison and the art culture in Vancouver and why there seems to be a lack of one
- full moon, walk along riverside, crazy how different vancouver sea wall is
- waddle on to roti bar! randomly spotted it and was wanting to take Bean to try Roti!
- grabbed that and they were closing, went home, did not have enough rice... went to super market to get 1 minute cook rice
  
feel:

- exhausted, tired and looking forward to sleep!
- QVM, feels so late away, bean learned about this 1min rice from a k drama and won't answer the question
- favourite part of the day -> exploring and taking photos with Bean. Everytime I saw bean be like, oooh I have a photo! I was like yay! bean found something, that was super cool to see!

tierlist:

Current: a super light gelato, I thought the flavour was super strong, straticetlla wasn't my favourite flavour but the pistacho flavour was amazing. it felt super light I think I usually like heavier gelatos but the flavour was so good that I am ranking A tier!
